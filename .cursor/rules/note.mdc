   - Client-side filtering and grouping logic

## Files to Modify

1. `src/components/admin/activity-log/data-table/index.tsx` - Main data table component
2. `src/hooks/activity-log/index.ts` - Activity log hooks
3. `src/types/activity-log.type.ts` - Type definitions
4. New components for enhanced features

## Task Status: ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETED

The enhanced Activity Log UI/UX has been successfully implemented with significantly improved user tracking and traceability capabilities. The interface now provides:

- Multiple view modes for different analysis needs
- Advanced filtering for precise data discovery
- Better visual presentation with action grouping
- Enhanced user identification and activity patterns
- Professional dashboard-style statistics display

Only real-time updates remain to be implemented, which would require WebSocket or polling integration.

# Lessons

## Next.js Dynamic APIs

- Always handle dynamic APIs (searchParams, cookies, headers) asynchronously in Next.js 15+
- Use React.use() in Client Components to unwrap dynamic API Promises
- Use await in Server Components to unwrap dynamic API Promises
- Never access dynamic API properties directly without awaiting

Example for Server Components:

```typescript
interface PageProps {
  searchParams: Promise<{
    id?: string;
  }>;
}

export default async function Page({ searchParams }: PageProps) {
  const params = await searchParams;
  // Now you can safely use params.id
}
```

Example for Client Components:

```typescript
"use client";

import { use } from "react";

interface PageProps {
  searchParams: Promise<{
    id?: string;
  }>;
}

export default function Page({ searchParams }: PageProps) {
  const params = use(searchParams);
  // Now you can safely use params.id
}
```

## Cursor learned

- follows Next.js's server-first pattern throughout the application
- Next.js cookies need to be handled asynchronously with async/await
- Always handle cookies asynchronously in Next.js 15+
- Always use the updated cookieStore method in Next.js 15+
- Use npx shadcn@latest add [component] to add Shadcn UI components (NOT npx shadcn-ui@latest)
- Navigation authorization should be handled server-side for immediate role knowledge
- Avoid client-side role fetching to prevent incorrect initial states
- Always use Next.js Image component (<Image />) from 'next/image' instead of HTML <img> tag for better performance and optimization
- TypeScript interfaces for handbook components are located in src/types/handbook.ts
- Always add null checks for optional props in React components and provide fallback UI to prevent runtime errors
- The project is already running on port 3000 - don't try to start it again

## Chart Components & Dashboard Development

- Use `type ChartConfig` instead of `ChartConfig` when importing from chart UI components to avoid linter errors
- Always cast `any` values to proper types in chart tooltip formatters to prevent unsafe assignment errors
- Use `String(value)` to safely convert unknown values to strings in chart components
- Prefer nullish coalescing operator (`??`) over logical or (`||`) for safer default value assignment
- Use proper TypeScript assertions with specific types instead of generic `as any`
- Chart components should include proper loading states with Skeleton components
- Format currency values consistently using `Intl.NumberFormat` for VND display
- Administrative dashboard should include: revenue analytics, booking statistics, staff performance, service popularity, and recent activity tables

## Advanced Chart Improvements

- **Complete Timeline Display**: Always show full date ranges in charts, even for dates without data
- Use `date-fns` functions like `eachDayOfInterval`, `subDays`, and `format` for comprehensive date handling
- Create data mapping with `Map` to efficiently merge backend data with complete date ranges
- **Dual Y-Axis Charts**: Use separate Y-axes for different data types (revenue vs bookings) with proper scaling
- **Enhanced UI Design**: Implement gradient backgrounds, custom icons, and improved spacing for professional appearance
- **Smart Tick Intervals**: Adjust X-axis tick intervals based on time range (every day for 7d, every 2nd day for 30d, weekly for 90d)
- **Interactive Elements**: Add hover states, active dots, and improved tooltips for better user experience
- **Currency Formatting**: Implement short-form currency display (K, M, B) for Y-axis labels to save space
- **Responsive Chart Height**: Use larger chart containers (350px vs 250px) for better data visualization

## Storage System & Image Preview

- **Image Detection**: Use MIME type checking to identify image files (`isImageFile()` helper)
- **Error Handling**: Always implement fallback UI for failed image loads in preview components
- **User Experience**: Provide visual hints like hover overlays to indicate interactive elements
- **Consistent Behavior**: Ensure image preview works consistently across both grid and list views
- **State Management**: Use centralized state (Zustand) for dialog management across storage components
- **Performance**: Use HTML `<img>` for preview functionality when Next.js `<Image />` optimization isn't critical
- **URL Construction**: Use `downloadUrl` from MinIO file objects for direct image preview
- **Component Props**: Always add optional callback props (`onImageClick?`) to maintain backwards compatibility
